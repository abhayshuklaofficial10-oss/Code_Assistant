🤖 Code Assistant – AI-Powered Code Helper

Code Assistant is an AI-powered coding companion that helps developers generate, debug, and optimize code effortlessly. Built using Gradio and Ollama, this project demonstrates a practical application of AI for real-world coding tasks.

🔹 Key Features

AI Code Generation: Generate code snippets or solutions based on user prompts.

Interactive Interface: Uses Gradio Blocks for a user-friendly web interface.

Context-Aware Responses: Maintains conversation history to provide coherent and context-aware answers.

Multi-Language Ready: Can be adapted for Python, JavaScript, and more with the right AI model.

Easy Setup: Lightweight and runs locally via an API endpoint.
